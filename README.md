#Library Management System

Library Management System is a console-based application that allows users to manage books in a small library. It supports adding new books, borrowing and returning them, viewing available and borrowed books, and saving/exporting data.
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, data handling with lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and practical use of Python modules like json, csv, and datetime.
